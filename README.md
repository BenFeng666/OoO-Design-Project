# Out of Order (OoO) Processor 🚀

A high-performance execution engine simulation. This project explores the transition from a traditional synchronous pipeline to a dynamic, out-of-order execution model.



---

## 📊 Current Status: Phase 1 (In-Order)
We are currently establishing the **In-Order Baseline**. This ensures that the fundamental architectural states—Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback—are functioning correctly before we introduce the complexity of dynamic scheduling.

### Project Roadmap
- [x] **Phase 0:** Architecture Design & ISA Definition
- [> ] **Phase 1:** In-Order Pipeline (Current)
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Scoreboarding / Tomasulo’s Algorithm
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Register Renaming (RAT/FL)
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Speculative Execution & Reorder Buffer (ROB)

## 🧩 Planned Features (Out-of-Order Phase)
Once the In-Order foundation is stable, the following OoO features will be implemented to increase **Instructions Per Cycle (IPC)**:
